# Fetch product opinions

## Overview

This Python script is designed to fetch opinions from an e-commerce website asynchronously.
It can retrieve opinions related to products or orders, filter them based on a specified date
and store the results in CSV files. The script uses **asyncio** and **aiohttp** for efficient
network operations, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data from web sources.
